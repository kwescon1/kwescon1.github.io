# Welcome

👋 Hi, I’m Kwesi Odame Danquah

👀 I am a dedicated professional with extensive experience in building maintainable, robust, and testable software. As an efficient problem solver and fast learner, I excel in team environments and thrive on creating impactful solutions. My interests lie in AI solutions, data analysis, Financial Technology, and Healthcare.

🌱 I hold both a BSc and an MSc in Computer Science.

🎯 Awards? Not yet—but give me time! I’m working on it. 🤝

💡 I’m always looking to collaborate with anyone eager to create innovative solutions together.

The code you read here today might be different tomorrow. Why? Because I evolve. I embrace new ideas, learn better approaches, and continuously strive to be better than I was yesterday.

Check out my [Library](/docs/reading_lists/) for a collection of [Books](/docs/reading_lists/books/), [Blogs](/docs/reading_lists/blogs/), and [Papers](/docs/reading_lists/papers/) I’m exploring on my journey of growth.
